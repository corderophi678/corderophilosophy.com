<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

_Euthyphro_ finishes up with Socrates on his way to court to stand trial for breaking laws against impeity. _Apology_ picks the tale back up during that trial. In it, Socrates offers an _apologia_, a legal defense, in an attempt to convince the 501 jurors -- all fellow Athenians -- of his innocence.

As John M. Cooper, the editor of the edition of Plato's works I have, notes in his own introduction to _Apology_, we have no way of knowing whether or how accurate Plato's retelling is. But what's more likely is that it's Plato offering the best defense that he (Plato) thought Socrates could have given. Despite this, we still talk about it as though it's Socrates' own defense. We still say, "Socrates says..."

In the defense Socrates offers (see?), he takes each charge raised against him and attemps to show the jurors that the charge should not stand -- either because it was made in bad faith, or even if guilty, it's through ignorance and not malice and so not a legal matter, or that the charge is just downright false.

Spoiler Alert: Socrates is found guilty and put to death. Does that mean Socrates failed? In one important way, yes -- he failed to convince enough jurors of his innocence. But in another way...well...let's see what Socrates has to say and we can judge for our selves. 

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

We're plopped right in the middle of the trial. Socrates starts his defense after his accusers, a bunch of [Sophists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophist), have presented their case. They say, again, that he's violated the laws of impiety, offending the gods of the city, by speaking and teaching about new gods. 

At the very beginning of _Apology_, there's what seems like an oddly disjointed conversation about whether or not Socrates took money in exchange for teaching people. Since all we have in _Apology_ is Socrates' side of the case (with the exception of a brief exchange Socrates has with Meletus, he (Socrates) is the only one doing any talking), it might take a little guesswork to hash out this part of the piece. In fact, since it's not super important for the broader picture, and since I'm not super certain anyway, I'll just say this: Presumably, if it's wrong to teach a thing because it 'corrupts' the student, then it would be even worse to charge the student for those lessons.

Things start to get interesting around _20e4_, where Socrates mentions the Oracle at Delphi, [Pythia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia). From here, there are two parts to Socrates' defense. Socrates believes that many of the jurors will have prejudicial beliefs about him because of his reputation for being a bit of a jerk. So, the first part of his defense is an effort to explain away that reputation and to justify his own actions that led to him getting the reputation he has. The send part of his defense more directly addresses the charges of impiety.

The first part of his argument goes like this: Socrates' friend, Chaerephon went to speak with the Oracle at Delphi and asks if anyone is wiser than Socrates. And wouldn't you know, the Oracle tells Chaerephon that no one is wiser. So, Socrates, being the humble fellow he was, finds himself very confused when Chaerephon tells him this. Socrates claims to think that he isn't wise -- perhaps you've heard that Socrates says that all he knows is that he doesn't know anything. Now, Socrates doesn't think the Oracle is lying, so the confusion persists. He decides he'll go around and talk to all the people who are known to be wise. He'll have a conversation with them in which they'll reveal that they are wiser than he is and he can go show the Oracle that they were wrong. 

So off he goes. He finds someone who's supposed to be wise and talks. But the conversation doesn't go well and Socrates shows that this person is not, in fact, wise at all. And when this happens, the person is upset with Socrates and dislikes him. A regretable consequence, sure, but Socrates tries again. And again. And again. After he's spoken to all the supposedly wise people without finding anyone truly wise, he goes and talks to regular people with no reputation for wisdom. Some of these folks, Socrates admits, do know many things that he does not, and so in that regard are wiser than he is. But when looking at overall wisdom, including all practical and theoretical knowledge, Socrates finds all of these folks to be less wise than he is.

As a result of all these conversations, Socrates gained a reputation not only for being a bit of a jerk, but also for being wise. As he says, each time he showed someone that they weren't as wise as they thought, they assumed that Socrates _had_ the wisdom that he showed they _didn't_. But that's not what Socrates was trying to do at all. His quest to find a person wiser than himself is a quest that he says was handed down to him from the Oracle at Delphi. Socrates understands the Oracle's claim about his wisdom to be claim about what human wisdom is worth.

> "What is probable...is that in fact the god is wise and that his oracular response meant that human wisdom is worth little or nothing, and that when he says this man, Socrates, he is using my name as an example, as if he said: 'This man among you, mortals, is wisest who, like Socrates, understands that his wisdom is worthless.'" [23a3-b2]

The god has said that no one is wiser than Socrates. And so Socrates takes it upon himself to show everyone that the god is correct about this. So all who take themselves to be wiser than Socrates must be shown they are not. And, again, after each conversation, the person Socrates was talking to ends up upset and disliking him. 

To make matters worse, since Socrates is, well, _Socrates_, there are loads of young people who follow him around watching him on his quest. And, as folks tend to do when they see something they admire, Socrates' students try to do what he does. They turn around and try to show other people that they're not as wise as they think. But when a student of Socrates shows a person that they're not as wise as they thought, the person doesn't get upset with the student. The person gets upset with Socrates for teaching the student this particular set of skills. As a result of _this_, the number of people upset with Socrates grows even more. 

The second part of Socrates' defense is focused more on the specific charges Meletus and his friends brought against Socrates. Those charges,

> "[go] something like this: Socrates is guilty of corrupting the young and of not believing in the gods in whom the city believes, but in other new spiritual things." [24b4]

With regard to corrupting the young, Socrates attempts to analyze this charge so as to show its absurdity. See, according to Socrates, no one ever willingly does something that would harm themselves. So, the idea that Socrates would make the people he surrounds himself with worse by corrupting them intentionally is nonsense. As he says, the wicked harm others around them. And if he were to make those around him wicked, then they would harm him. But in making them wicked, he would therefore be harming himself. And no one ever does that -- no one **can** do that, it's just not psychologically possible, according to Socrates.

As for not believing in the city's gods, but in other gods, Socrates again attempts to show that Meletus is talking nonsense. Meletus says that Socrates doesn't believe in the city's gods, but instead in other spiritual things. But, Socrates says, either these spiritual things are themselves gods or else they're the children of gods. If these spiritual things are themselves gods, then Socrates believes in the gods. If instead they're the children of gods, then Socrates _must_ also believe in the gods because, 

> "...what man would believe children of the gods to exist, but not gods? That would be just as absurd as to believe the young of horses and asses, namely mules, to exist, but not to believe in the existence of horses and asses." [27d5-e8]

At this point Socrates takes himself to have sufficiently refuted Meletus' charges against him. Those charges were a load of rubbish anyway. Socrates knows his reputation and the fact that he's not well-liked is far more dangerous than Meletus' charges. Anticipating the question, Socrates says,

> "Someone might say: 'Are you not ashamed, Socrates, to have followed the kind of occupation that has led to your being now in danger of death?'" [28b2]

And Socrates says no. What does death have to do with anything? All that matters is whether you do what is right. Furthermore, since no one **knows** what death _is_, why should anyone be afraid of it? Socrates claims that to be afraid of death is to presume knowledge of what death is like -- namely, that it's bad. But since we can't have that knowledge, we shouldn't assume anything about death -- good or bad. Since we can't know what death is like, but we _do_ know that it's bad to do the wrong thing and good to do the right thing, fear of death should never stop us from doing what's right.  

And, indeed, Socrates is so confident that he's been living his life the right way that he says straight up that even if he's acquitted, he's going right back on his bullshit. He's on a mission -- not just to show people that they aren't as wise as they think they are, but to help everyone to become _good people_. He wants to show them that nothing matters as much as having a good soul.

> "Wealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence makes wealth and everything else good for [people], both individually and collectively." [30b2]

Socrates is so committed to doing the right thing that he goes on to tell the jury that if they sentence him to death, they will be harming themselves more than they would be harming him. As someone who's trying to make people care more about being _good_, he sees himself as doing a great service for the city. Sentencing Socrates to death would be depriving the city of one if its most devoted citizens. 

In the end, the jury finds Socrates guilty and Meletus asks for the penalty of death. Ultimately, Socrates has a choice to make. He can accept exile from Athens and live out his days somewhere else or he can accept the death penalty. Being the good and devoted Athenian he was, Socrates chose death rather than abandon his city. 

<h2 id="reflect">Reflect</h2>

For me, there are two or three themes that stick out as most worthy of further discussion. First, there's Socrates' claim that no one ever willingly harms themselves. Second, there's the idea that there's no reason to fear death because we can't know anything about what it's like. Finally, there's the idea that excellence, or virtue, is the most important thing -- more important than success or even life and death. In the interest of keeping the length of this post, you know, manageable, I'm only going to talk about the first of these three points. The other two -- whether death is a harm and how much virtue should count in our decision processes -- are things I plan on talking about at much greater length at a future date.
 
So...

Do people willingly harm themselves? In Socrates' case, the question was whether he was willingly making the people with whom he associated wicked. Two questions, then: Was he making them wicked? Was he making them wicked willingly? 

Socrates thinks that by questioning people about the things they claim to know, and showing them that they don't know as much as they think, he's making them wiser. He's showing them that their beliefs about what they know are false. So, as far as he's concerned he's doing them a favor and certainly not making them wicked. Is he right in his assessment of his own behavior, though? I mean, sure, he didn't think he was making them wicked...but was he?

Who knows? If it's as he says, and he was just trying to get people to be good people, to care more about being good people than about material posessions and status, then yeah, maybe he's right. If he's just trying to get people to accept and admit the limits of their own knowledge, to only talk about things that they actually know, then yeah, maybe he's right. Of course, there might be reason to suspect the accuraccy of Socrates' assessment of his own behavior.

Suppose he's wrong, though. Even if he's making them wicked, since that's not what he believes he's doing, he can't be doing it _willingly_. And, as Socrates says, if he's making them wicked out of ignorance, he should be reprimanded and corrected, not taken to court and sentenced to death. 

Now, of course, the broader claim that no one willingly harms themselves isn't proven by Socrates' particular case. Just because _he_ wasn't willingly making his followers wicked doesn't mean that no one ever willingly harms themselves. It might seem that people willingly harm themselves all the time. 

For instance, I'm currently in a seated position that causes me some degree of pain (kind of a lot). Sitting with my right ankle tucked under my left hip causes my right knee lots of pain. But sitting in a different position causes me _more_ pain in other areas of my body. I know it's not good for me to sit like this, but it's better for me than sitting like _that_. So, am I willingly harming myself? 

The pain here, the harm I'm doing myself, seems to be a side-effect of the thing I'm doing -- namely, sitting -- and not my aim; it's not what I'm _trying_ to do. Are the side-effects of our intended actions things that we also intend to do, that we do willingly? You scratch your arm and skin cells fall off. Did you shed those skin cells willingly? You walk a mile and your shoes are worn down. Did you wear down those shoes willingly? My intuition says 'no', you don't do these things willingly, since they're not the things you intend to do.

It seems to me that Socrates is onto something when he says no one willingly harms themselves. The most obvious cases of people harming themselves that I can think of (jumping on a grenade to save a group of people from harm, taking harmful drugs) all seem to me cases in which the harm isn't what is intended. So, it's hard for me to think of cases where self-harm is what is _intended_. Even in the case of suicide, it's not entirely clear whether the _harm_ is what's intended. Rather, it seems there is a harm already present that suicide seems the only or best answer to. At least, this is how it seems to me given my own personal experiences with suicdial ideation and discussions I've had with folks who have had similar experiences. People have different reasons for doing things that we might say are "the same action".
