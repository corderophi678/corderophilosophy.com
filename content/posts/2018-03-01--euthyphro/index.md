**NB: A short note on references:
Since ancient philosophers' writings weren't kept in books with numbered pages, marginal notation systems were developed so that references could be made to various passages without regard for things like differences in translation. So, along the margins of many versions of ancient texts you will often find some combination of numbers and letters which indicate where in the original text the translated passage can be found. For example, "_Euthyphro_ 10d1" is a reference to the 10th (I don't know...parchment page or scroll maybe), section d, line 1.**

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

_Euthyphro_ was the very first bit of Plato that I read. I like it. In it, Socrates is brought to court, by a young Athenian called Meletus, to face charges of corrupting the young by teaching impious things. On his way, he meets Euthyphro who is himself coming back from court, having just raised charges of murder against his own father. 

Socrates and Euthyphro get to talking and Socrates, as they say, is back on his bullshit. Maybe you've heard of the Socratic Method of teaching? It's the idea that you ask questions of your students in order to lead them to knowledge, rather than just giving it to them directly by listing out facts or figures. Well, it's called the _Socratic_ Method, ain't it? That's how Socrates rolled. 

Euthyphro is, on the face of it, about the concept [piety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piety). What does it mean for a thing to be pious or its opposite, impious? Piety isn't like size or weight -- it's not a thing easily measured. And what Socrates is after are necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be pious or impious. He wants to know what features of an action, for example, have to be there for an action to be pious, as well as the features that, if present, mean that the action is pious. 

For example, it's necessary for a thing to be a square that it have four right angles. But rectangles also have four right angles. So, it's necessary for a thing to be a square that it have four right angles but it isn't sufficient. On the other hand, it's sufficient for a thing to be a triangle if it's a closed figure with three angles. So, again, we have the conditions that a thing has to have in order to be what it is and we have the things that, if they're there, they mean the thing is the thing it is.

So what are the necessary and sufficient conditons for a thing to be pious? <small>The answer may shock you!</small>

Socrates and Euthyphro, then. Socrates is being charged with corrupting the young and Euthyphro is accusing his own father of murder. 

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

The conversation starts with both people explaining what they're doing at court. Euthyphro's story goes like this. One of Euthyphro's servants killed a slave. Euthyphro's father bound the servant hand and foot and threw him in a ditch, then sent a messenger to ask a priest what to do with the servant. Before the person sent to the priest got back, the servant died. 

That, according to Euthyphro is murder. And even though his family is upset with him because, as they say, "it is impious for a son to prosecute his father for murder" [4e1], Euthyphro claims to have superior knowledge of piety than his family. As he says,

> "I should be of no use, Socrates, and Euthyphro would not be superior to the majority of men, if I did not have accurate knowledge of all such things." [4e5-5a1]

And this is where things get fun or annoying, depending on whether you're a Socrates or a Euthyphro fan.

Socrates asks Euthyphro to teach him all about piety so that he, Socrates, may better defend himself in court. Socrates asks Euthyphro to tell him what piety _is_. What follows is a series of suggestions from Euthyphro and rebuttals from Socrates. Every time Euthyphro offers a definition of piety, Socrates finds a problem with it and demands a better one until Euthyphro finally just gives up and upon Socrates' request that he continue says, 

> "Some other time, Socrates, for I am in a hurry now, and it is time for me to go." [15e3]

"Time for me to go..." Such a clear and explicit blow-off. "Nahhhh...I'm done here, man. If you ain't leavin', I am!"

So, to recap. Here are the main suggestions Euthyphro offers and the Socrates' rebuttals.

First, Euthyphro says, 
> "...the pious is to do what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer, be it about murder or temple robbery or anything else, whether the wrongdoer is your father or your mother or anyone else; not to prosecute is impious." [5e1]

To which Socrates responds that this is just an example of a thing that's pious. And it's pretty clear, right?, that there are other ways to be pious. So this can't be what it is for a thing to **be** pious.

Euthyphro's second effort isn't much better, "...what is dear to the gods is pious, what is not is impious." [7a1] Because, since the gods disagree with one another, some things would be both pious **and** impious. But that's not what we're after. We want to know what it means to be indisputably pious.

The natural response, then, is that the pious is what **all** the gods love, and the impious is what **all** the gods hate.

And this is where things get a little squirrely. Because the question is now whether the gods love pious things _because_ they're pious things or whether instead the things are pious _because_ the gods love them. It's a question of priority: Which comes first, the features of the thing that make it pious and therefore loved by the gods, or is the feature that makes it pious the _fact_ that it's loved by the gods?

After a bit more back and forth, Socrates presses Euthyphro to offer another suggestion. Socrates asks if Euthyphro thinks whether or not everything that is pious is also just (as in, _just_ice). Euthyphro says yes, and after some pressing clarifies,

> "...the godly and pious is the part of the just that is concerned with the care of the gods..." [12e3]

Socrates' response is to ask what in the world it means to 'care' for the gods? In what way could we care for the _gods_? Surely, no way at all. They're gods.

Another suggestion! The pious is knowledge of how to sacrifice and pray to the gods.

Socrates asks, again, what can we give to the gods? And if we can't give to the gods, then isn't a pious relationship with the gods a very one-sided one? One in which we offer them futile sacrifices, since we can't give anything to them, and beg them for favors.

Finally, Euthyphro circles back to the beginning and says that the pious is that which is pleasing (or dear) to the gods.

After this, he gives up and walks away.

I think this is a fairly good starting point for someone interested in philosophical methodology -- or, at least, a certain type of philosophical methodology. Lots of philosophy is conceptual analysis -- which is exactly what it sounds like. It's the analysis of concepts through various means. Socrates is a forerunner of modern day 'counter-example philosophy', where someone proposes a theory and some other very clever person (Socrates) proposes a counter-example to the first person's theory. A good theory is resistant to counter-examples and a bad theory is weak to them. 

So when Euthyphro says that the pious is "to prosecute the wrongdoer", he's offering an account of piety that's vulnerable to counter-examples. There are lots of them -- anything that is pious but isn't at the same time a case of prosecuting a wrongdoer is a counter-example to Euthyphro's first suggestion. So this account can't be an account of what piety **is**. 

Maybe the most interesting part of this dialog is Socrates' response to Euthyphro's suggestion that the pious is what all of the gods love. And it's interesting because the question Socrates poses to Euthyphro is one that we can ask about all sorts of things around us today. Think of how you might define something like a patriotic action. Or maybe you know someone who claims that right and wrong are determined by their preferred god. Is what's right right because god says it is? Or does god say it's right because, prior to god saying so, it is right? This can be a very vexxing question for some folks.

On the one hand, if what is right, or pious, or just, is simply a matter of what the gods say -- if the god's say-so is what makes it right, pious, or just -- then that can change if the gods change their minds. Given how capricious and petty the Greek gods were, this would be a real worry. One day you're tending your crops in the right way, as the gods require. And the next day, if the gods change their minds, you're doing it all wrong and causing them great offense. 

On the other hand, if the gods love what is right, pious, or just because it's right, pious, or just, then why do we need the gods to know anything about how to live? If actions, as we say, have the _properties_ of rightness, piety, or justice _independently_ of what the gods say, then maybe the gods are sort of superfluous.

These sorts of questions, questions of priority -- what comes first, what depends on what -- are super important questions. Plato was largely concerned with the **conceptual** issues here -- he wanted to get at the _true definition_ of piety. But the **practical** implications of the answers we give to these conceptual questions are massive -- which is why it's so important to get the answers to the conceptual questions right.

We often act in ways that suggest there are principles guiding our actions. For example, we tend to follow the legal codes of the places where we live. Perhaps we tend to think that following the laws is the _right_ thing to do. But, (a), is it right because that's what the laws say to do? Or, (b), do the laws say to do that because it's right? Thinking about things this way, you might wonder whether or not there are some laws that it's _not_ right to follow because they themselves are _wrong_. That, in turn, might make you wonder where legal authority comes from.

Let's stop there, before we get too far down _that_ rabbit-hole, though.

Right, next up [Apology](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DApol.). In _Apology_, Plato gives an account of Socrates' trial -- the same trial he's on his way to when he runs into Euthyphro. He offers his defense against the charges Meletus has brought against him -- we'll see whether it's a good one. 

(Ron Howard's Voice: It wasn't. He's found guilty and put to death.)

Look for a post on _Apology_ in about a week's time, maybe sooner depending on how pain management goes this week.
